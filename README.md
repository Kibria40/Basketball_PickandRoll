# Basketball Pick and Roll Detection System

This project utilizes a static camera setup alongside an advanced AI model to detect intricate movements in basketball games, focusing on the strategic play known as the pick and roll. By analyzing video footage, the system identifies players, referees, the basketball, and the basket itself. It uses track IDs to monitor the movement of the basketball between players, allowing for the detection of pick and roll plays. Additionally, it quantifies the duration of each pick and roll maneuver executed by players.
